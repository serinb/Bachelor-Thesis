Most of the users had screen locks on their personal phones. It would be more interesting to create a long study in which the participants are known to not comply with smartphone authentication and see whether or not they prefer the concept that requires little orientation. Then contact them some time later and see if they changed to using a screen lock.

Our first study included a wider range of demographic yet unfortunately our data could no longer be used. in order to truly validate these findings it would be reasonable to purposely select a wider range of demographics such that the number of IT savy paticipants equals the amount of non IT savy people.
