%*****************************************

The following chapter presents a user case study which was intended to complement and validate the findings made by Anonymous et al. \cite{anonymous} (see Chapter \ref{ch:third}). The chapter begins by introducing the design of the user case study. Next, the demographic of the recruited participants is presented, followed by a documentation of the study's procedure. Last, the quantitative and qualitative results of the study are discussed. The goal of the research contribution was to examine the effect of \textit{orientation time} on the perceived efficiency of authentication mechanisms. 

\section{Design} \label{5.1}

The user case study was designed as a field study which was conducted in two destinations: on campus of the computer science department at Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit{\"a}t Bonn (Uni Bonn) and at the author's home residence. The independent variable was \textit{ratio} and it had three levels:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{long} orientation/\textcolor{red}{short} input (abbrv. \textit{long/short}), 
    \item \textcolor{red}{short} orientation/\textcolor{blue}{long} input (abbrv. \textit{short/long}), 
    \item \textcolor{red}{short} orientation/\textcolor{red}{short} input (abbrv. \textit{short/short}). 
\end{enumerate}

The implemented concept \underline{\textbf{FiPa}}, presented in Chapter \ref{ch:forth}, served as a medium to represent the ratios of interest. The order of the ratios was counterbalanced amongst the participants (see figure \ref{fig:permutation}). Data was collected quantitatively by measuring the \textit{orientation} and \textit{input time} for each of the ratios, as explained in Chapter \ref{ch:forth}. Data was also collected qualitatively through a questionnaire, which required study participants to evaluate the aesthetic of the application\footnote{Although this is slightly beyond the scope of the research, I was interested in seeing whether the design of the application had an impact on participants' performance. These observations will be presented later in Chapter \ref{ch:sixth}.}, the ratios (\textit{long/short} and \textit{short/long}), and to also choose which of the two ratios they preferred most. On average, the duration of the study was 20 minutes per participant. 

\section{Participants} \label{5.2}

Twenty-five participants were recruited for the study. Initially, students were informed about the study through a social platform for computer science students at Uni Bonn. Another part was collected on campus of the university's computer science department, and four participants were acquaintances of the author of this thesis. There was no premise for participating in the study, meaning anyone was eligible to partake. Participants who made input-errors (see Section \ref{4.3.2}) were excluded from the evaluation. Nineteen valid data entities remained, of which 13 (62.4\%) were male and 6 (31.6\%) were female. The average age was 21 years, with 17 being the youngest and 31 being the oldest age. The majority of the participants (78.9\%) had an IT-Background and were computer science students. Also, all participants, except for one, used a screen lock for their smartphones: 42.1\% used \textit{Pin}, 36.8\% used \textit{Pattern}, and 15.8\% used \textit{Password} (see figure \ref{fig:demo}).

\section{Procedure} \label{5.3}
The study was held for each participant, separately. First, the experimenter provided a introduction on the study purpose to the participant:

\begin{center}
\textit{Analysis of certain factors of a smartphone authentication process that might play a role in its perceived efficiency.}    
\end{center}

It was also emphasized that the improvement of usability in authentication mechanisms was of interest and that the security aspect was outside the scope of this research study. Moreover, participants were assured that the testing of \underline{\textbf{FiPa}} was not intended to evaluate their cognitive skills or intelligence. It also was important that they felt comfortable and that they did not feel nervous or put under pressure during the course of the study, as it could impact negatively validity of the obtained results.\\

Next, the experimenter described the structure of the application, representing the concept \underline{\textbf{FiPa}}. They explained to the participant that it was meant to emulate an activity, which resembled an authentication concept. They explained the application presented a series of small "challenges", for the participant to solve\footnote{"Challenges"  meant the \textbf{mental} and \textbf{practical tasks}, explained in Chapter \ref{ch:forth}.}. The simple challenges were demonstrated with the help of the paper prototype, shown in figure \ref{fig:paperprototype}.\\

\caption{Demographic data on the \textit{gender} (left), \textit{IT-Background} (middle) ration and on the \textit{personal screen lock choice} (right) of the participants.}
\label{fig:demo}
\end{figure}

After ensuring that the participant had no further questions, the experimenter proceeded by presenting the application to the participant. The application was installed on an Android smartphone provided by research group of Dr. Emanuel von Zezschwitz.\\
First, the participants were advised to begin with the training-segment of the application, presented in section \ref{4.3.2} (see figure \ref{fig:flow}). The purpose of the training-segment was to ensure that the participant understood the concept of \underline{\textbf{FiPa}} and to reduce the number of errors in the quantitative data set. As mentioned in Section \ref{4.3.2}, the participant was allowed to repeat the training-segment, until they felt ready to start with the actual testing the concept. During the training-segment, the experimenter guided them through the process, when help was needed, and explained certain features, such as the \textit{error-recovery} and the method of input. \\

When the participant felt ready to start the test, the experimenter entered a unique \textit{user-id} for the participant. The experimenter did not intervene, as the participant was executing the actual test of the application. Once the participant was done, they were given a questionnaire to fill out (see Appendix \ref{ch:appendix}). At the end of the study, each participant was compensated with 5 Euros.

\label{fig:combination}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Measurements}

 As mentioned earlier, \textit{orientation} and \textit{input times} were measured for each ratio. , each \textit{combination} presents three different challenges (couples, see Section \ref{4.2.2.4}). Analogous to the measurement approach in section \ref{4.2.2.4}, we considered the first and second challenge of each combination to be an exercise for the user. Despite the training-segment, participants made a significant amount of mistakes in the first two challenges, and made very little to non in the third. We excluded all of the data entities which included any unsuccessful input activities. This gave us a clean collection of 19 data sets. \\

We will start by analysing the measured times of each combination (see figure \ref{fig:combination}). Although, we designed the combinations \textit{Short/Long} and \textit{Long/Short} (see Section \ref{5.1}) to be as close to each other as possible, regarding their duration, our results show that they had a temporal difference of 1176 ms, on average. The combination \textit{Long/Short} had the longest duration, followed by \textit{Short/Long} and, lastly, \textit{Short/Short}.

We took it upon ourselves to thoroughly examine the times of each phase in the combinations and compare them to each other, to see how the crossing phases (short or long) differ from each other (see figure \ref{fig:times}). We did not notice a significant difference between the \textit{input} times of combinations \textit{Short/Short} and \textit{Long/Short}. Nonetheless, it is interesting to see that, on average, participants needed slightly less time to enter the pattern in \textit{Long/Short} than they needed in \textit{Short/Short}, being that patterns in both combinations are the same. \textit{Short/Short} and \textit{Short/Long} show a slightly notable difference in terms of their average \textit{orientation} times (663 ms).

\label{fig:times}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Users' Perception}

We decided to focus the qualitative evaluation on the \textit{combinations} on \textit{Long/Short} and \textit{Short/Long}. We assumed that by setting them against each other, we could get precise insight on which one the participants favor more. To ensure that they did not confuse the \textit{combinations}, we gave them an illustration of the two \textit{combinations} and verbally explained it to them.

The participants were asked to evaluate both \textit{combinations} separately, through five-point Likert scales (see figure \ref{fig:survey2}, questions 11-12). When asked whether they found the searching process (\textbf{mental task}) of \textit{Long/Short} annoying, the answers were split between \textit{agree} (8) and \textit{disagree} (8). Three participants found no difference between the two combinations. Also, most participants were able to memorize (89\%) and enter (84\%) the pattern (\textbf{practical task}) easily (see figure \ref{fig:likert}). In contrast, all participants disagreed that the search process \textit{Short/Long} was annoying. Also, all agreed that the pattern was easy to memorize and 89\% agreed that it was easy to enter (see figure \ref{fig:likert}).\\
 
 \begin{figure}[t!]

\caption{An evaluation of the combinations \textit{Long/Short} and \textit{Short/Long} using five-point Likert scales. }
\label{fig:likert}
\end{figure}

Next, the participants were asked certain questions (see figure \ref{fig:likert2}), where they had to actively choose which of the both combinations they found applied more. These questions were also answered through Likert scales (see figures \ref{fig:survey2}, \ref{fig:survey3}, questions 13-17). When asked which one they found required more mental effort, the majority (68\%) chose \textit{Long/Short}, about 16\% chose \textit{Short/Long} and the rest saw no difference between the two. 
About 79\% thought that \textit{Short/Long} was easier, followed by a 16\% finding \textit{Long/Short} easier. We also asked which patterns they perceived took longer to find and enter. Fifty-eight percent said that \textit{Short/Long's} pattern longer to enter, 26\% chose \textit{Long/Short}, and 16\% saw no difference. All participants found that the pattern in \textit{Short/Long} took longer to find. Lastly, we asked them which combination they found to be more efficient. Interestingly, no one actively chose \textit{Long/Short}. Seventy-four percent found \textit{Short/Long} more efficient and 26\% saw no difference. \\


Moreover, we wanted to examine how far participants' time estimation differed from the actual measurements. In terms of which pattern they found took longer to find, 36\% (4) misestimated and chose \textit{Long/Short}, while \textit{Short/Long} was actually true. Also, in terms of which pattern took longer to enter, 18\% percent (2) thought \textit{Short/Long} was longer and 36\% (4) saw no significant difference, while in both cases \textit{Long/Short} was true.

Regarding their estimates of the overall times, five participants misestimated. In four cases, \textit{Short/Long} was actually longer and in only one case \textit{Long/Short} was longer. In addition, two participants saw no difference between both combinations, while in their case \textit{Short/Long} took more time overall. \\

\caption{Participants were asked to compare the combinations \textit{Long/Short} and \textit{Short/Long} to each other by answering the questions above. These questions were answered using Likert scales. }
\label{fig:likert2}
\end{figure}

Furthermore, we wanted to get a clearer understanding of our participants' preferences. They were asked to declare which combination they would choose if they had to use one of them as their screen lock. Participants were also asked to elaborate on their choice, given four possible reasons to choose from: \textit{It's more efficient / more secure / more difficult / challenging}\footnote{Multiple answers were possible.}.
Forty-two percent (8) chose \textit{Long/Short}, whereas 47\% (9) chose \textit{Short/Long} (see figure \ref{fig:preference}). Most frequent reasons given for choosing \textit{Long/Short} were that is was \textit{more secure} and \textit{more difficult}. Only one participant gave the reason \textit{more efficient} and two gave the reason \textit{challenging}. Interestingly, one participant elaborated further on her choice and wrote that \textit{Short/Long} would be more comfortable. \\

In contrast, most popular reasons for \textit{Short/Long} were \textit{more secure} and \textit{more efficient}. The reasons \textit{more difficult} and \textit{challenging} were only given once, each. Two participants elaborated that they would choose the combination because it is easier, especially for when one is tired. Eleven percent chose neither combination as a screen lock and gave the following reasons (see figure \ref{fig:preference}): 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{"Short/Long is much easier because it's easier to find.\\ It's also much easier to copy => Insecure! I would prefer a mix [of both]."}
    \item \textit{"It don't mind which one, because their use will get easier over time. It really just depends on one's mood."} 
\end{itemize}

Although the main focus of our study, was to solely examine the \textit{orientation} and \textit{input} phases, we did not what to neglect the potential effect that the pop-up feature of our prototype might of had on participants' performances (Section \ref{4.3}). Thus the pop-up appeared on the screen as a reaction to successive search errors, we considered it to be a form of \textit{error recovery}. We added a question into our survey which only had to be answered if a participant encountered the \textit{error recovery} phase, during their execution. Statements were evaluated via a Likert-scale (see figure \ref{fig:survey3}, question 19). Out of 19 participants, only 6 experienced the \textit{error recovery} (see figure \ref{fig:error}). When asked whether the pop-up feature helped them find the pattern faster, five of the concerned participants agreed. Only one participant disagreed. Moreover, half of the concerned participants disagreed that the pop-up elongated the searching process. However, one agreed and two answered with \textit{neutral}. Lastly, when asked whether they found the pop-up annoying, four disagreed, one agreed, and another answered with \textit{neutral} (see figure \ref{fig:error}). \\
